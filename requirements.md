## Todo-List Application Requirements

This document outlines the essential requirements for developing a functional and user-friendly todo-list application.

### 1. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system *must do*.

#### 1.1 Core Todo Management

*   **FR1.1.1: Create Todo Item**
    *   The user shall be able to add a new todo item by providing a description.
    *   The todo item shall automatically be marked as "pending" upon creation.
    *   The system shall automatically record the creation timestamp.
*   **FR1.1.2: View Todo Items**
    *   The system shall display a list of all existing todo items.
    *   Each todo item shall display its description and completion status.
*   **FR1.1.3: Mark Todo as Complete**
    *   The user shall be able to mark a pending todo item as "complete".
    *   The visual representation of the todo item shall clearly indicate its completion status (e.g., strikethrough, checkmark).
*   **FR1.1.4: Mark Todo as Incomplete**
    *   The user shall be able to mark a completed todo item back to "pending".
*   **FR1.1.5: Edit Todo Item**
    *   The user shall be able to modify the description of an existing todo item.
*   **FR1.1.6: Delete Todo Item**
    *   The user shall be able to permanently remove a todo item from the list.
    *   The system shall prompt for confirmation before deletion.

#### 1.2 Optional Todo Item Attributes

*   **FR1.2.1: Set Due Date (Optional)**
    *   The user shall be able to assign an optional due date to a todo item.
*   **FR1.2.2: Set Priority (Optional)**
    *   The user shall be able to assign an optional priority level (e.g., Low, Medium, High) to a todo item.

#### 1.3 Filtering and Sorting

*   **FR1.3.1: Filter by Status**
    *   The user shall be able to filter the list to display only "pending" todo items.
    *   The user shall be able to filter the list to display only "completed" todo items.
    *   The user shall be able to view all todo items.
*   **FR1.3.2: Sort Todo Items**
    *   The user shall be able to sort todo items by creation date (ascending/descending).
    *   The user shall be able to sort todo items by due date (ascending/descending, if applicable).
    *   The user shall be able to sort todo items by priority (e.g., High to Low, if applicable).
    *   The user shall be able to sort todo items alphabetically by description.

#### 1.4 Data Persistence

*   **FR1.4.1: Local Storage**
    *   All todo items and their attributes (description, status, due date, priority) shall be persistently stored locally (e.g., browser's localStorage, a local file, or a simple embedded database) so they are retained between application sessions.

#### 1.5 User Interface

*   **FR1.5.1: Input Field**
    *   The application shall provide a clear input field for adding new todo items.
*   **FR1.5.2: Action Controls**
    *   Each todo item in the list shall have readily accessible controls for marking complete/incomplete, editing, and deleting.
*   **FR1.5.3: Filter/Sort Controls**
    *   The application shall provide intuitive controls (e.g., buttons, dropdowns) for filtering and sorting the todo list.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define *how* the system performs a function.

#### 2.1 Performance

*   **NFR2.1.1: Responsiveness**
    *   All user interactions (adding, completing, editing, deleting, filtering, sorting) shall complete within 500 milliseconds under normal conditions.
*   **NFR2.1.2: Load Time**
    *   The application shall load and display the todo list within 2 seconds for a typical list of up to 100 items.

#### 2.2 Usability (UX)

*   **NFR2.2.1: Intuitiveness**
    *   The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to understand for first-time users without requiring extensive training.
*   **NFR2.2.2: Feedback**
    *   The system shall provide clear visual feedback for all user actions (e.g., a "task added" message, visual change on completion).
*   **NFR2.2.3: Error Handling**
    *   The system shall prevent users from adding empty todo items and provide a clear error message if attempted.
*   **NFR2.2.4: Consistency**
    *   The visual design and interaction patterns shall be consistent throughout the application.

#### 2.3 Reliability

*   **NFR2.3.1: Data Integrity**
    *   The application shall ensure that todo items are not accidentally lost or corrupted, especially during unexpected closures or reloads.
*   **NFR2.3.2: Stability**
    *   The application shall remain stable and free from crashes or unhandled exceptions during normal operation.

#### 2.4 Maintainability

*   **NFR2.4.1: Code Quality**
    *   The codebase shall be well-structured, modular, and adhere to established coding standards to facilitate future enhancements and bug fixes.
*   **NFR2.4.2: Documentation**
    *   Key components and complex logic shall be adequately documented (e.g., inline comments, architectural diagrams).

#### 2.5 Security (Minimal for local app)

*   **NFR2.5.1: Data Isolation**
    *   If using browser local storage, ensure that todo data is confined to the application's origin and not accessible by other websites.

#### 2.6 Compatibility

*   **NFR2.6.1: Web Browser Compatibility**
    *   The application shall function correctly and display consistently across modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). (Assuming a web-based app).
