## Todo List App - Development Tasks

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   [x] Create project directory and initialize Git repository.
    *   [ ] Set up development environment (e.g., IDE, linters).
    *   [x] Choose project structure and technologies (e.g., React, Vue, Angular for frontend; Node.js, Python/Flask, Go for backend).
2.  **Backend Development:**
    *   [x] Design database schema (e.g., tasks, users, categories).
    *   [x] Implement user authentication and authorization (Register, Login, Forgot/Reset Password).
    *   [x] Develop API endpoints for:
        *   [x] Creating tasks
        *   [x] Reading tasks (single, all, filtered, search, subtasks)
        *   [x] Updating tasks
        *   [x] Deleting tasks
        *   [x] Managing categories (field exists, and dedicated endpoints implemented)
        *   [x] User profile management (basic user data implemented)
        *   [x] Creating projects
        *   [x] Reading projects (single, all, members)
        *   [x] Updating projects
        *   [x] Deleting projects
        *   [x] Managing project members (add, remove, get)
    *   [x] Implement task persistence (database integration).
    *   [x] Implement task scheduling and reminders.
3.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   [x] Create project structure and basic React application.
    *   [ ] Create user interface for task management.
    *   [ ] Implement task list display with filtering and sorting.
    *   [ ] Implement task creation and editing forms.
    *   [ ] Implement user authentication and registration.
    *   [ ] Implement responsive design for various devices.
    *   [ ] Integrate with backend API.
    *   [ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality for task prioritization.
4.  **Advanced Features:**
    *   [x] Implement task categories and tags (field exists and usable in search).
    *   [ ] Implement task dependencies.
    *   [ ] Implement recurring tasks.
    *   [x] Implement priority levels (field exists and usable in CRUD/search).
    *   [x] Implement due dates and reminders (due dates implemented, reminders not yet).
    *   [ ] Implement collaboration features (e.g., shared lists - project members is a start, but assigning tasks to other users still needs work).
    *   [ ] Implement file attachments.
    *   [x] Implement subtasks.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for backend logic.
    *   [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints.
    *   [ ] Perform user interface testing.
    *   [ ] Conduct cross-browser compatibility testing.
    *   [ ] Perform performance testing.
6.  **Deployment:**
    *   [ ] Configure backend deployment environment.
    *   [ ] Configure frontend deployment environment.
    *   [ ] Deploy backend API.
    *   [ ] Deploy frontend application.
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Write API documentation.
    *   [ ] Write user documentation.
    *   [ ] Create a README file with project information.
8.  **Maintenance:**
    *   [ ] Monitor application performance.
    *   [ ] Fix bugs and address user feedback.
    *   [ ] Implement new features and improvements.
