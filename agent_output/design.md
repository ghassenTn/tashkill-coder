# Advanced Todo-List Application - System Design

## 1. Architecture

We will use a three-tier architecture:

*   **Presentation Tier (Client):**  User interface (web, mobile, desktop) for interacting with the application.
*   **Application Tier (API/Backend):**  Handles business logic, data processing, and API requests.
*   **Data Tier (Database):**  Persistent storage for todo items, user data, and other application data.

## 2. Components

### 2.1. Presentation Tier (Client)

*   **UI Components:**
    *   Todo List View: Displays todo items with filtering, sorting, and grouping options.
    *   Todo Item Editor:  Allows creating, editing, and deleting todo items.
    *   User Authentication: Login, registration, and profile management.
    *   Settings:  Application-specific settings (e.g., theme, notifications).
*   **Technology:**  React, Angular, Vue.js (for web), Swift/Kotlin (for mobile), Electron/similar (for desktop).

### 2.2. Application Tier (API/Backend)

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/todos`:  CRUD operations for todo items.
    *   `/users`:  User authentication and profile management.
    *   `/categories`: CRUD operations for todo categories.
    *   `/settings`:  Application settings.
*   **Business Logic:**
    *   Todo item management (creation, update, deletion, completion).
    *   User authentication and authorization.
    *   Category management.
    *   Search and filtering.
    *   Notifications and reminders.
*   **Technology:**  Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring Boot), Go.

### 2.3. Data Tier (Database)

*   **Database Schema:**
    *   `users`:  Stores user data (ID, username, password, email, etc.).
    *   `todos`:  Stores todo items (ID, title, description, due date, priority, category, user ID, status).
    *   `categories`: Stores categories (ID, name, user ID).
    *   `settings`: Stores user-specific settings (user ID, theme, notification preferences).
*   **Database Technology:**  PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.

## 3. Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction:**  User interacts with the UI (e.g., creates a new todo item).
2.  **API Request:** The client sends an API request to the backend (e.g., POST /todos).
3.  **Business Logic:** The backend processes the request, performs validation, and interacts with the database.
4.  **Data Persistence:** The backend stores or retrieves data from the database.
5.  **API Response:** The backend sends a response back to the client (e.g., success/failure).
6.  **UI Update:** The client updates the UI based on the API response.

## 4. Advanced Features Considerations

*   **Collaboration:** Support for shared todo lists and task assignments.
*   **Integration:** Integration with other services (e.g., calendar, email).
*   **AI-powered Features:** Smart suggestions for due dates, priorities, and categories.
*   **Offline Support:** Ability to use the app offline and synchronize data when online.
*   **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Seamless experience across web, mobile, and desktop.
